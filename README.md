A simple Python script that detects DDoS, 0 Byte, SYN, UDP, and other attacks, and automatically bans the attacking IPs. The ban commands are currently for Windows but can be swapped for Linux as well. Additionally, the values can be freely chosen.

This script is primarily designed to protect RPC / REST / Socket interfaces, but it also protects HTTP/S traffic.
